a potential plot for a multiplayer team-based game based on the Mahabharata, with twists in every scene:

The game takes place during the epic war of Kurukshetra, between the Pandavas and Kauravas. Players will have to choose a side to fight for and join a team of warriors. Each team will be led by a famous warrior from the Mahabharata, such as Arjuna or Karna.

The game will start with a tutorial on basic combat skills and team coordination. As the game progresses, players will encounter various challenges and obstacles that require strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. For example, they may have to devise a plan to infiltrate the enemy's stronghold or protect their own territory from enemy attacks.

Throughout the game, players will also encounter various twists and turns in the story. These could include unexpected betrayals from their own team members, hidden agendas from their leaders, or unexpected alliances with unlikely allies.

One twist could involve a secret weapon that could turn the tide of the war. Both teams would be searching for this weapon, but it turns out that it was hidden in plain sight all along, and the team that discovers it first will have a significant advantage.

Another twist could involve a sudden shift in power dynamics. For example, the Kauravas may receive reinforcements from a powerful ally, which could cause the Pandavas to reevaluate their strategy.

As the game reaches its climax, players will have to face off against their opponents in an epic final battle. The outcome of the war will depend on the decisions made by the players and the strategies they have developed throughout the game.

Overall, the game would require players to work together as a team, communicate effectively, and adapt to unexpected changes in the storyline. With twists and turns in every scene, the game would be both engaging and challenging for players of all skill levels.
