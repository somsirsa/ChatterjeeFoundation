Specify drunkenness level and talk to a bartender in a pirate tavern. The drunker you are, the weirder the tales the bartender tells you.
10 different levels of drunkenness + adds suitable picture

EEG captures level of drunkenness to output suitable story -> the drunker you are the weirder the story
Requirements:

How to derive drunkenness from EEG (already have some leads based on band activity)
What prompts to give ChatGPT based on the drunkenness to create interesting dialogue; other game mechanics?
How to present the results

We need to get the data from the Unicorn using one of the free APIs that come with the Unicorn Suite into something which allows us to develop a game with graphics.

Initial Situation

Imagine this - you and your friends are at a party, and the drinks are flowing freely. As the night wears on, you start to feel a little buzzed. You're having a great time chatting and laughing with your friends, but you're also curious about what's going on inside your brain. What does your brain activity look like as you get drunker and drunker?
That's when you notice a table in the corner of the room with a strange-looking device on it. As you approach, you realize that it's an EEG machine. The person manning the table explains that they're using the EEG to capture brain activity and generate a fitable story with ChatGPT that gets progressively weirder as you get drunker.
Intrigued, you sit down and let the person place the electrodes on your scalp. As the EEG begins to register your brain activity, ChatGPT springs to life and starts to create a story based on your current level of drunkenness. You can't wait to see where the story will go as you continue to drink and your brain activity changes.


Idea / Solution

EEG to capture the level of drunkenness/inebriated behavioral pattern + generate a fitable story with ChatGPT that gets progressively weirder as the user gets drunker/passes out.
To derive drunkenness from EEG, we can look at changes in brain activity, particularly in the alpha and beta bands. As the user becomes more intoxicated, the alpha waves decrease while the beta waves increase
Based on the level of drunkenness, ChatGPT can be prompted to create interesting and increasingly bizarre dialogue. For example, at a low level of drunkenness, ChatGPT could create a story about a simple adventure, but as the user becomes more intoxicated, the story could turn into a surreal and absurd journey.
The results could be presented in a visually engaging way, with a progress bar indicating the level of drunkenness and accompanying graphics that change as the story becomes weirder.

Reflection

As the night wears on and the drinks continue to flow, you find yourself increasingly captivated by the EEG machine and the story that ChatGPT is generating. The more you drink, the weirder the story becomes, and you can't help but marvel at how accurately the technology seems to be capturing your level of drunkenness.
As the story takes unexpected twists and turns, you find yourself laughing and joking with your friends, enjoying the unique and entertaining experience that the EEG machine has brought to the party.
As the night draws to a close and the EEG machine is packed away, you find yourself reflecting on the experience. You're struck by how technology can be used to create new and exciting experiences, and how even something as simple as an EEG machine can provide a glimpse into the inner workings of the brain.
Overall, you're grateful for the opportunity to have participated in this unique and entertaining experiment, and you can't wait to see what other innovative uses of technology are just around the corner.
